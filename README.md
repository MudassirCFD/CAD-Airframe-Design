CAD and Airframe Design - Cessna 172 Wing Optimisation
Project Description
This repository contains the complete analysis and optimisation study of a Cessna 172 aircraft wing using integrated Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and Finite Element Analysis (FEA) methodologies. The project demonstrates a systematic approach to aerospace structural optimisation, achieving a 42% mass reduction while maintaining structural integrity.

Key Features
Parametric CAD Model: Fully parameterised Cessna 172 wing model developed in CATIA V5

CFD-FEA Integration: Aerodynamic loads from CFD simulation applied directly to structural analysis

Structural Optimisation: Gradient-based optimisation to minimise wing mass subject to stress constraints

Manufacturing Considerations: Design parameters include practical manufacturing constraints

Validation: Results validated against handbook data and engineering principles

Technical Details
Software: CATIA V5, ANSYS Fluent, CATIA Generative Structural Analysis

Methodology: Integrated CFD-FEA workflow with parametric optimisation

Key Result: 42% mass reduction (154.2 kg to 89.4 kg) with stress maintained below allowable limits

Validation: CFD-derived wing loading matched reference values within 5% accuracy
